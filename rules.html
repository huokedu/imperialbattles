<h2 align="left">How to start a game:</h2>

<p align="left">You can join a game that has already been set up by clicking a game in the server browser, then pressing the join button just below the server browser box. Once you set up your team and colour, hit ready and wait for the 'host' to start the game.</p>
<p align="left">If there are no available games, or you want to 'host' a game, click the create button below the server browser box. You will then be on the game setup screen, where you can choose the map to be played on, and the turn timeout. You can still choose a colour and team for the game. You can also kick players for the game, and you will need to start the game once all players are ready.</p>

<h2 align="left">Playing a game:</h2>
<p align="left">Each player starts with an initial set of units that will be the same colour as that which they chose to play as during game set up. The aim of the game is to defeat all of the enemy units, and keep yours alive. If you are on a team, you will also win if team-mate(s) are left alive at the end of the game.</p>
<p align="left">You defeat enemy units by moving your units so that enemies are within your attack range, then selecting to attack them until they have 0 health. All units start with 10 health. Your units will do damage according to attack bonuses, the defence offered by the terrain, and the atttacking unit's health. The more health the attacking unit has, the more damage they do.</p>
<p align="left">The game is played in turns, and you can see whose turn it is by looking at the turn display in the top-left hand corner of the game screen. This will also be yellow if it is your turn, and white if not. You can move and/or attack with each of your units once per turn. Your units will have a green dot next to them if they can still take an action, and a red dot if they have already moved or attacked for that turn.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot select any units when it is not your turn. When it is your turn, click on one of your units to select it. It will then display its move range by higlighting cells in range in blue. Either click on a cell inside the highlighted area and then click the move button to move there, or double click on the cell you wish to move to. You can deselect a unit by clicking outside of its movable range. To attack a unit, move your unit so that the target is within your unit's attack range, then click on an enemy highlighted in red (which signifies that it is within your unit's attack range), then click attack. Alternatively, you can also double click on an enemy unit once you have selected a unit to immediately attempt to attack it. You can see any unit's attack range by holding down the mouse over a unit. Archers notably have a minimum attack distance, so must be at least one cell away (and within three cells) from an enemy to attack them.</p>
<p align="left">Spearmen do bonus damage to Lancers, Lancers do bonus damage to Archers, and Archers do bonus damage to spearmen. Archers do reduced damage against Lancers, and Lancers do reduced damage against spearmen (but spearmen do not do reduced damage to Archers).</p>
<p align="left">Terrain protection offered, from least to most, is: roads & rivers, plains & marshes, woods, towns & camps.</p>
<p align="left">After attacking an enemy unit, if the enemy is still alive and within their attack range of the attacking unit, they will retaliate, and perform an attack against the attcking unit. As their health has probably been reduced by the initial attack, they will generally retaliate for less damage than the attacker did, but it is still worth bearing in mind.</p>
<p align="left">The game will automatically end when all units are defeated. If you are defeated before the game ends, you can either continue watching the game, by clicking continue on the defeat screen, or return to the game selection screen by clicking exit.</p>

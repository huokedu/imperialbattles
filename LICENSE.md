# License/Copyright

## Summary

This project was initially created as a collaborative effort, and then later updated by me (ThothRex). I am not a lawyer, so my understanding of the resultant copyright is fuzzy. My best guess is that the work I made from start to finish is wholly owned by me, some of the work I have updated is now my copyright due to substantial (explicitly allowed) alterations, and some of the works' copyright is held by the other contributors.

You will have to read the full text of this document to understand the details, but a vague, inaccurate summary is as follows (THIS SUMMARY IS NOT TO BE USED FOR LEGAL PURPOSES):
* Most custom js & PHP code, and HTML are probably owned by me, these can be used under the terms of the MIT license.
* All images have exclusive copyright, owned by different people.
* Font licenses are in copyright_info_string.html .
* PHP and JavaScript libraries are distributed under the terms included in their relevant source files.
* For all other files, I cannot remember who wrote them, so I cannot say who owns the copyright. This does not mean they are copyright-free.

## Details

### Fonts

Their terms are provided via the links in copyright_info_string.html . The fonts themselves are in the fonts/ directory.


### PHP and JavaScript included from other sources

Their licenses are referenced in their relevant source files. These files are:
* js/jquery.cookie.js
* js/jquery.gamequery-0.7.1-patch1.js
* js/jquery-1.10.1.min.js
* js/json2.js
* lib/password.php (the license is also explicitly included in lib/password-php/LICENSE.md)


### The part I (thothrex) made

This is licensed under the MIT license:
* js/model.js

Any parts which become mine due to substantial alteration, I also license via the MIT license.

I have been given verbal permission by the other main authors (the ones credited in README.md) to modify and distribute the work as I see fit. However, this was a vague permission.

My understanding of copyright law, though, is that if I create a derivative work that is significantly different from the initial work, and I've been given permission to make the derivative work in the first place, that I gain ownership of that derivative work's copyright. Basically, if the 'git blame' lists me as the most recent editor for all non-trivial parts of the file, and it's for an edit after the initial commit, then I think I have ownership of the copyright. My understanding of copyright law is fuzzy though, as was the agreement made between us, so I can't be certain of the details.


### Images

The copyright for the images is mixed. The following ones listed were made by James. The copyright for these is either owned by James, or was granted to me (ThothRex). I can't remember, so to be safe, it's best to treat it as if the copyright is held by him (i.e., you cannot do anything covered by copyright with the work without his explicit permission).
Relevant files:
* img/bg.jpg
* img/bg_blur.jpg
* img/logo.png
* img/rules.png
* img/sprite_sheet.png

I can't remember the copyright for the other images, so it's probably best to leave them be.

### Everything else

I don't remember.

## TL; DR
It's a mess - don't try and sell this.
